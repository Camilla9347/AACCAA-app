**Logical Layers**


**Running the project**

To run the application type

```
$ npm start
```
within the AACCAA-app folder

**Note**

The Authentication workflow and the general Express Web Framework was developed following the *NodeJS Tutorial and Projects Course*, created by John Smilga (https://github.com/john-smilga) for the udemy online learning and teaching marketplace.
Also the https://github.com/john-smilga/node-express-course.git repository was found to be very useful in the development phase.
